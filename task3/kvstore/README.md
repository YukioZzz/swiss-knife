By following this readme you can reproduce the kvstore experiment described in our report.<br><br>
First, change to the parent directory `task3` and run `nix-shell`. This will load the packeges specified in shell.nix that are needed for reproducing.<br>
Then, change back to `task3/kvstore` and run `python3 reproduce.py` (This will take a while. Probably more than an hour. Please bare with us)<br>
Finally, find the resulting plots and logs in the `task3/kvstore/result` folder.<br>
